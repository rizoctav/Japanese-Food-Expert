  'Tempura is a wildly popular Japanese dish of deep-fried seafood and vegetables encased in a light yet most shatteringly crisp batter. Neither greasy or heavy. They are indeed the best fried.',

  'Pick up the sushi with your clean hands. Sashimi and ginger are picked up with chopsticks.Tilt the sushi fish-down to apply only a hint of soy sauce. The rice and the soy sauce are not supposed to touch.Place the sushi on your tongue face-down as well. This way, you get the full flavor and freshness of the fish. Eat the sushi piece all in one bite. If the sushi is too big, tell the chef so he can adjust the proportion for you. He will find the best part of the fish that can accompany the size of sushi to suite you.Eat ginger between sushi pieces, not while you still have fish in your mouth.',
  'When eating tempura at a restaurant, one of the most important things to keep in mind is the order of eating each piece. When several pieces of tempura are included on one plate, it is standard for the lighter-types (vegetables, shrimp, Japanese whiting) to be placed in front of the heavier-types (such as anago eel). It is recommended to eat the tempura from the front toward the back, as its believed that the flavors will grow deeper in this manner.'
